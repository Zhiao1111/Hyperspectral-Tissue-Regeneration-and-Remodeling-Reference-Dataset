## Description of dataset
Data Source: The regenerative bioscaffolds used in this study were developed by Beijing Ruijian Gaoke Biotechnology Co.

 
Data content: The dataset is mainly divided into two parts: reflectance spectroscopy data and transmission spectroscopy data. Each part of the data comes from different tissues and time points:

- Animal muscle tissue (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 weeks)
- Animal subcutaneous connective tissue (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 weeks)
- Unimplanted ECM samples (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 weeks)
- Post-implanted ECM samples (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 weeks)
- For each exposed stent sample or animal tissue sample, spectral data were collected from 10 different locations. Spectra for representative exposed stent samples or animal samples were obtained by simple arithmetic averaging of the above data. Also, spectra from multiple samples were collected in each section.

 
Data Representation: In the dataset, spectral wavelengths are shown in red text and collected spectral data are shown in black text.
